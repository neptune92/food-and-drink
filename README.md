# food-and-drink-SOS

## Description
As a group we were tasked with creating a web application using two relevant web API's. We decided we would like our application to provide both food and cocktail recipes for the user based on search criteria. The user would be provided with an image, as well as a link to the full recipe. 




## Usage
* As a user I want to be provided with a resource to find food recipes.
* When I use this application I am able to search recipes by dietary preference (eg. Vegan, Keto, Pescetarian, etc.)
* When I provide my dietary preference I can refine my search with keywords in the search bar.
* When I click the submit button a search result is displayed with an image of the meal, and a link to the recipe.
* As a user I also want to be provided with an additional search option for cocktails.
* When I click the dropdown field I am provided with liqour options.
* When I choose a liqour and click submit I am provided with an image and cocktail recipe in the empty space of the webpage.
* When I am given both food and drink recipes they are stacked accordingly in the empty space provided to the right of the webpage. 
* Search results are stored in the local storage when the submit button is clicked.
