# food-and-drink-SOS

## Description
As a group we were tasked with creating a web application using two relevant web API's. We decided we would like our application to provide both food and cocktail recipes for the user based on search criteria. The user would be provided with an image, as well as a link to the full recipe. 




## Usage
* As a user I want to be provided with a resource to find food and cocktail recipes.
* When the webpage is opened I am provided with two search fields in the left side of the page.

* When I use this application I am able to search recipes by dietary preference with a dropdown input (eg. Vegan, Keto, Pescetarian, etc.)

* When I provide my dietary preference I can refine my search with keywords in the search bar.

* When I click the submit button a search result is displayed with an image of the meal, and a link to the recipe.
* As a user I also want to be able to generate a random cocktail.
* When I click the generate button a random cocktail recipe will generate.
* When I am given both food and drink recipes they are stacked accordingly in the empty space provided to the right of the webpage. 

* The webpage is responsive to changes in size and on mobile device.

* Search results are stored in the local storage when the submit button is clicked.
